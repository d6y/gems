# Source code examples from Coding Gems

Each example from the presentations is in a package (e.g., _src/main/scala/example1_). Inside
each package is the _problem.scala_ example and the _solution.scala_ presented.

* Example 1: Configuration, or when Option might not be the right option.

* Example 2: Stringly typed. If you want to run this example, know that it connects to a Postgres database.  See _database.scala_ for configuration.

* Example 3: Being able to read unit tests.  This is in the _src/main/tests/_ package.
