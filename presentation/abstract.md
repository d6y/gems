This session explores difficulties teams are experiencing with Scala, and how to overcome them. If you're starting or growing a team, the code examples and alternatives we present may help you progress faster.

The examples are from commercial code reviews across a wide range of developers and projects. We've seen what developers are struggling with, and how teams are shipping code while getting to grips with Scala.

We will look at examples including:

*    managing error handling and configuration
*    failure to use the type system
*    battling with libraries; and
*    making code easier to read and maintain.

Behind each piece of code there's a reason why the code ended up that way. Richard will provide suggestions from the Scala ecosystem that would give a better result.
